      <h3>Evolution of Character</h3>
      <p>As a child in Calamba, Rizal displayed curiosity, artistry, and compassion, nurtured by his mother’s teaching and his father’s discipline. His early education at home and in local schools laid the foundation of his brilliance and sensitivity.</p>
      <p>During his years in Ateneo, UST, and later in Europe, Rizal matured into a reformist intellectual. Encounters with European ideas, sciences, and arts expanded his worldview. He wrote novels, essays, and poems that gave voice to the oppressed, showing his growth from student to advocate for reform.</p>
      <p>Exiled in Dapitan and ultimately condemned in Manila, Rizal’s final years revealed his unwavering sense of duty. He accepted his fate with dignity, evolving from reformer to martyr whose death gave birth to a revolution and cemented his place as the national hero.</p>
