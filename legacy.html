  <h2>Legacy</h2>
  <p>Jose Rizal’s legacy is deeply embedded in the history and identity of the Philippines. As a nationalist, writer, and reformist, he used his intellect and pen to advocate for peaceful reform during the Spanish colonial era.</p>
  <p>His novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo exposed the injustices and abuses of the colonial government and the clergy, awakening the Filipino people's sense of nationalism.</p>
  <p>Rizal’s execution on December 30, 1896, made him a martyr and intensified the revolutionary movement against Spain.</p>
  <p>Beyond his writings, his unwavering commitment to education, freedom, and equality continues to inspire generations.</p>
  <p>Today, Jose Rizal is remembered not only as the national hero of the Philippines but also as a symbol of courage, integrity, and intellectual resistance against oppression.</p>
